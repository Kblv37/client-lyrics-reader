Someday
Moto Boy

Someday, I'll find all my rounds to be complete
Sometimes, I know I'll break the ice beneath my feet
And baby, then from memories as I recall
Something you told me from the start
You can't hide what's in your heart


Sometimes, I feel it would be easier to pretend
To be halfhearted would mean half a heart to mend
And baby, then from memories as I recall
Something you told me from the start
You can't hide what's in your heart


You can't hide what's in your heart
You can't hide what's in your heart
You can't hide what's in your heart
You can't hide what's in your heart
You can't hide what's in your heart
