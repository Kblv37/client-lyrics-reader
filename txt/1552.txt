Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want
Deftones

Good times for a change
See, the luck I've had can make a good man bad

So please, please, please
Let me get what I want

Lord knows it would be the first time
Haven't had a dream in a long time

See, the life I've had can make a good man bad
So, for once in my life, let me get what I want

Lord knows, it would be the last time
Lord knows, it would be the first time
