Lost
The Cranberries

Feel the storm is coming in
I wonder where should I begin
In the past
In the past
I feel I'm dwelling in the past
I know the time is moving fast
And you know
I'm lost with you
I'm lost without you

I wonder when I should give in
I wonder when I should begin
To let it go
I feel like I'm dwelling in the past
I know the time is moving fast
I want you to know
I'm lost with you
I'm lost without you

Bring in the night
Bring in the night
Bring in the night
Bring in the night
Bring in the night
Bring in the night
Bring in the night

Lost with you
And lost without you
I'm lost with you
And I'm lost without you
(So lost, so alone)
Yeah, I'm lost without you (So alone, so alone, so alone)

Bring in the night
Bring in the night
Bring in the night
Bring in the night
