New born
Muse

Link it to the world,
Link it to yourself,
Stretch it like a birth squeeze.

The love for what you hide,
For bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born

You've seen, seen too much
Too young, young:
Soulless is everyone.

Hopeless time to roam.
The distance to your home
Fades away to nowhere.
How much are you worth?
You can't come down to earth.
You're swelling up,
You're unstoppable.

Cause you've seen, seen too much
Too young, young:
Soulless is everyone.

Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away.

Just break a silence,
Cuz I’m drifting away
Away from you.

You've seen, seen too much
Too young, young:
Soulless is everyone.

Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away.

Just break a silence,
Cuz I’m drifting away
Away from you.
